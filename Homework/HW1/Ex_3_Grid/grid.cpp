// Design
/* Write a C++ program that can depict a square grid with column and row labels such that it might be useful for a game
 * like Battleship or Chess. Set all cells to be periods as default characters. Allow the player to specify the row and
 * column and place an 'X' in that cell.
 * Loop until the user enters a negative value.

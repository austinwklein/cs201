// Description:
/* Rewrite your function so that it prints its parameter backwards. So if your function is given the
 * string “about”, then it should print “tuoba”.
 *
 * Here, i is the index; its value can range from 0 to size−1, where size is the number of characters
 * in the string. This can be received by calling ss.size().

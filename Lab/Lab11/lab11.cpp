 * Characters in a string
 */

// Description:
/* Write a program that repeatedly inputs a word from the user and then
 * prints the characters in the word that are lower-case letters, in
 * the order in which they appear in the word.
 *
 * Here, a  word is any sequence of non-space characters.
 * For example, “ 3rq%d$EzZ@[x” counts as a word.
 * If the above word is entered by the user, then the program should
 * output the following.
 *
 *      rqdzx
 *
 * Can you make use of auto in your program?
 * Possibly not. The use of the  auto keyword that we covered was introduced
 * into C++ in the 2011 Standard, while your compiler may be configured to use
 * an older standard. We will cover this issue in a forthcoming assignment.
 * For now, give  auto a try, and see if your compiler will accept it.
 *
 * Expand your program so that it prints the lower-case letters, as in part 1,
 * followed by the upper-case letters, on a separate line, followed by all
 * other characters, on a third line.
 *
 * If the word from part 1 is entered by the user, then the program should
 * output the following.
 *
 *      rqdzx
 *      EZ
 *      3%$@[
